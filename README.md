# Travel-Blog
##Problem Statement 
This project gives an overview about the aim, objectives, background and operation environment of a tourism information webpage, which is an online website for information about destinations. 
It is a software built for the users to view all the required details about a destination they want to go to.
 
 


The objective and scope of this project is to provide the user with all possible information regarding a particular location in one place. This website will help you plan your vacation with the utmost ease by reading through othersâ€™ experiences so as to help you have a better if not same journey. Deciding a holiday destination can be a tedious job with the vast range of options available and a never-ending list of dream places. People are unable to make a perfect travel plan due to a wide variety of reasons such as expensive tourism packages and lack of real-life data.

This project aims to be a one stop destination for all the information the user needs in order to make their right decision. Information is provided by bloggers who share from their personal experiences and thus provide realistic information. This helps the user make more efficient plans as the bloggers have already been exposed to their concerns.
